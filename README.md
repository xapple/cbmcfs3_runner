# `cbmcfs3_runner` version 0.5.0

`cbmcfs3_runner` is a python package for dealing with the automation and running of a complex series of models involving the European economy, the forest sector, carbon budgets and their interactions. Notably in relation to the CBM-CFS3 model developed by Canada.

The development version is hosted on git lab:
https://gitlab.com/bioeconomy/cbmcfs3/cbmcfs3_runner

## Warnings

This package is currently under heavy development, and the master branch is subject to breaking changes at any moment. If you are interested in using this package in your own installation, please contact the authors.

## Installing

No automated installation has been developed for the `cbmcfs3_runner` package yet. In the meantime, following this document and typing these commands on your command-line interface should get you started. If you cannot get a functional installation set up, contact the authors.

### Step 1: Cloning the repository

Here you will download a copy of the code from GitHub and place it in your file system.

    $ cd /
    $ mkdir repos
    $ cd repos
    $ git clone git@github.com:xapple/cbmcfs3_runner.git

### Step 2: Modify your python search path

Here you will edit your ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` to add a reference to the python package you just downloaded. If you are on Windows, you can change your environment variables with the `setx` command.

    $ vim ~/.bash_profile
    export PYTHONPATH="/repos/cbmcfs3_runner/":$PYTHONPATH

When you type `import cbmcfs3_runner` python will know where to look.

### Step 3: Install all required python packages

`cbmcfs3_runner` uses many third party python libraries. You can get them by running these commands:

    $ pip install --user autopaths
    $ pip install --user plumbing
    $ pip install --user pymarktex
    $ pip install --user pbs3

### Step 4: Retrieve European forest data

Here you will download a copy of the dataset that describes the forest inventory of 26 EU member states along with their historical harvesting.

    $ cd /repos/
    $ git clone git@github.com:xapple/cbmcfs3_data.git

NB: Currently the access to that repository is restricted. Please contact the authors.

### Step 5: Follow other specific instructions

Setting up the rest of the OS environment and installing the other required executables is covered in the `bioeconomy_notes` repository.

NB: Currently the access to that repository is restricted. Please contact the authors.

## Running the model

### Via an ipython session

To start an interactive session with the model on the command line, run:

    $ ipython3

At the ipython prompt, to import the continent object that gives access to simulations pertaining to the 26 countries, run:

    >>> from cbmcfs3_runner.core.continent import continent

For instance, you can now create a runner for the 'growth_only' scenario, the 'AT' country and the simulation period zero:

    >>> runner = continent[('growth_only', 'AT', 0)]

Finally, to run that step of the model:

    >>> runner.run(verbose=True)

## Accessing metadata

### Inventory start year and base year

The inventory start year and simulation base year are visible by creating a runner object for a given scenario (here called "static_demand") and by calling the following methods:

    from cbmcfs3_runner.core.continent import continent
    runner = continent[('static_demand', 'AT', 0)]
    runner.country.inventory_start_year
    runner.country.base_year

Reference years are defined in the `set_years` method of the [country](cbmcfs3_runner/core/country.py#L112). The simulation base year is the same for all countries, hard coded to 2015, the inventory start year differs.

## Timeline representation

The simulation is broken down into several periods which are represented below.
